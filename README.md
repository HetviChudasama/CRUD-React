This is a simple React project that demonstrates **CRUD operations** – Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It's useful for learning how to manage data in a React app.

## 🔄 What is CRUD?

CRUD stands for:

- **C** – Create: Add new data
- **R** – Read: Display or view data
- **U** – Update: Edit existing data

These are the basic operations used in most applications like to-do lists, user management systems, etc.
